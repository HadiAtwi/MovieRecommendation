Movienator - Android Movie Recommendation App
Movienator is an Android movie recommendation application built by two college students. The app fetches and displays a list of movies, along with their respective genres, allowing users to scroll through a movie catalog. As users scroll, more movies are fetched dynamically, providing a seamless browsing experience.

Features
Movie List Display: Presents a list of popular movies.
Infinite Scroll: Dynamically loads more movies when the user scrolls through the list.
Genres: Movies are tagged with their genres for better filtering and classification.
Error Handling: Alerts users with a message when there is no internet connection.
Technologies
Android SDK
Java
RecyclerView for efficient scrolling and list management.
Retrofit/Repository Pattern (assumed) to handle API calls.
Toast for error notifications.
LinearLayoutManager for managing the layout of movies in the list.
How It Works
Main Components
MainActivity:
The main activity that sets up the UI, handles user interactions, and manages fetching movies from the repository.
MoviesAdapter:
A RecyclerView adapter that binds movie data to the UI elements in the movie list.
MoviesRepository:
A singleton repository pattern for fetching movies and genres from the API (assumed to use Retrofit for HTTP requests).
Key Methods
onCreate(): Initializes the view, sets up the scroll listener, and begins fetching movie genres.
getGenres(): Fetches the movie genres and calls getMovies() to fetch the first page of movie data.
getMovies(): Fetches a page of movies and updates the RecyclerView with new data.
setupOnScrollListener(): Detects when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list and triggers the loading of more movies.
showError(): Displays an error message when there is no internet connection.
How to Run
Prerequisites
Android Studio installed
An Android device or emulator
API key for the movie database (e.g., TMDB API)
Steps
Clone the repository from GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movienator.git
Open the project in Android Studio.
Add your API key to the MoviesRepository class where the API calls are handled.
Build and run the project on an emulator or connected Android device.
API Integration
Movienator is designed to integrate with a movie API such as The Movie Database (TMDB). The repository pattern in the app makes it easy to swap out or upgrade the API without affecting the rest of the codebase.

Future Improvements
Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific movies.
Favorites: Let users mark movies as favorites and store them locally.
Movie Details: Display detailed information when a user clicks on a movie.
Filter by Genre: Add functionality to filter the list of movies by their genres.
Offline Support: Cache data for offline viewing.
